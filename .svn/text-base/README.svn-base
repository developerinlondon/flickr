What needs to be done?

    STORY 1

    As a flickr enthusiast I would like to see a carousel displaying a list of photos.

    Acceptance criteria:

    - Provide an implementation of a front-end-only JavaScript carousel, starting from the provided template, carousel.erb.
    - The carousel has to display a list of images loaded form a Flickr feed of pictures tagged 'bskyb'.
    - You are free to choose the kind of carousel you prefer (horizontal or vertical, animated or static...).
    - The carousel should be fully functional in IE 8+ and latest Chrome, with JavaScript enabled.
      Please do not use other JavaScript libraries or plug-ins, except jQuery.


    STORY 2

    Amend the existing flickr service to return a list of photo titles and images.

    Acceptance criteria:

    - Create a model class encapsulating the title and image only.
      - Start by writing a test.
    - Use json parser to process flicker response


    STORY 3

    Expose the service implemented in STORY 2 to feed data into your javascript carousel.

    Acceptance criteria:

    - Carousel created in STORY 1 should not be calling flickr directly.
    - Implement '/flickr' resource to return json
    - Ensure your carousel degrades gracefully, i.e. if no response, or an invalid response is returned, your carousel handles this appropriately.
